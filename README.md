# CS-300

What problem were you solving in the projects for this course?

This course focused on different data structures, including Binary Trees, Hash Tables, and Linked Lists, and explored their appropriate usage in various applications.

How did you approach the problem? 

Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I made an effort to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each data structure. My goal was to apply the best-suited structure based on the specific needs of the problem, ensuring that the benefits of the chosen structure outweighed its limitations.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or projects?

Whenever I encountered challenges, I relied on a combination of researching official documentation for methods or looking for example use cases. In some cases, I created small prototype code snippets to test ideas in isolation, gradually expanding them as the logic became more complex.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The focus on big-O analysis significantly changed the way I approach algorithm design, emphasizing performance. It made me more mindful of how operations scale as data grows. Additionally, I realized that my tendency to avoid recursion in certain designs might limit my ability to solve problems more efficiently, so I’ve worked on improving my recursive thinking.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through practice, I've become more comfortable writing maintainable code. For example, I now have reusable file stream functions that I can apply in future projects. I’ve also recognized areas where I can consolidate repeated code into libraries or helper functions, making my code cleaner and more adaptable for future use.
